  <title>So You Want To Survive A Zombie Attack!</title>
</head>

<html>
  The key to surviving a zombie apocalypse is preventing a zombie apocalypse. Notice how, in every zombie movie, no one knows what's going on and the contagion spreads like wildfire? Knowledge is your best weapon! This guide includes tips from horror movie expert (and roommate) Nicole that you can use to prevent the zombie apocalypse from occurring. If you are reading this too late and you are already living a hellish day-to-day nightmare existence, this site includes tips from my brother, who has read all the zombie literature he could get his hands on. In this case, we hope you can read this before our servers crash, and we will be holed up in Las Vegas, trying to start a new civilization. Join us, and godspeed!

          <li>If the outbreak is small, keep infected sedated and locked away while looking for a cute. Otherwise, don't hesitate to shoot at the head. Sacrifices must be made to ensure our survival!</li>
